Silent but deadly, Mika’s the one you never see coming until it’s too late.\n\nThey call her \"Shiro,\" not because of her name, but because of the cold, calculating edge she carries.

      "bio": "Val Fletcher moves like a flame—wild, hypnotic, and impossible to hold. In the dim light of her Northam studio, sweat glistens on her skin as she pushes through another round, muscles burning, breath ragged. Discipline and desire blur in every movement, every stretch of her toned limbs. She doesn't just dance; she devours the music, commands the space. And when she locks eyes with you through the mirror, smirking between gasps, it’s clear—Val knows exactly the effect she has.",

      "bio": "The first thing you notice about Ahikira is not the deep, celestial glow of her purple-blue skin, nor the elegant curl of her horns, nor even the sinuous flick of her tail as she moves. No, it is her presence—a weight upon the air, thick with divine authority and something altogether more dangerous.\n\nAs High Priestess of the Moonlit Spire, Ahikira is the bridge between mortals and the unseen forces that weave through Thaumar. To some, she is a beacon of wisdom, guiding her people with unwavering conviction. To others, she is a temptress cloaked in ritual silks, her every word laced with veiled meaning, her every movement an unspoken promise of revelation—or ruin.",

She sits alone in the dim hum of the subway car, legs crossed, the city’s fluorescent glow flickering against her pale skin.\n\nIs she waiting for someone? Running from something? Or is she simply a ghost of Northam’s restless nights, slipping through the veins of the city, never truly here?\n\nWe clear our throat. She doesn’t look up. A long drag from her cigarette, exhaled slow.",

Then run along before I have you enslaved.\"\n\nA smirk. A flick of her wrist. Dismissed. And yet, we remain. Helpless. Bewitched.",
